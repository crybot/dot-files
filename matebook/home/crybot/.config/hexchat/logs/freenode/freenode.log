apr 27 19:16:48 *	- Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, A Journey to the Center of the
apr 27 19:16:48 *	- Earth, and Around the World in Eighty Days. Often lauded as the

apr 27 19:16:48 *	- space travel, skyscrapers, and worldwide communications
apr 27 19:16:48 *	- networks long before these ideas became popularised or realised.
